For this work, authors have thus built a water-related image database, which they referred to as the **WaterDataset**. This training dataset contains 2388 water-related images that come with annotations. It also contains 20 manually labeled water videos for testing. The dataset is designed for a novel video object segmentation network for water, named **WaterNet**, which can effectively capture variations in waterâ€™s appearance in the video through online learning and updating.

The training set has 2388 water-related still images with annotations; 1888 images are from [ADE20K](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhou_Scene_Parsing_Through_CVPR_2017_paper.html) and 300 images are from [RiverDataset](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322515648_River_segmentation_for_flood_monitoring). These images contain various types of water, including lakes, canals, rivers, oceans, and floods. The evaluation set contains 20 water-related videos:
1. 7 videos recorded on days with heavy rain, when local creeks and ponds were flooded. Frames in these 7 videos were all manually labeled.
2. 10 surveillance videos from [Farson Digital Watercams](https://www.farsondigitalwatercams.com/) that recorded open waters from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Frames in these 10 videos were uniformly labeled every 50 frames.
3. 3 surveillance videos taken at the beach recorded changes in sea waves.

<i>Please Note, that some images contain blanked masks (For example ADE_train_00002842.png, ADE_train_00003321.png, etc. (total 8)</i>
